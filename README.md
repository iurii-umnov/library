# Library 📚

## Quick Start

1. First of all, clone repository

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:Mens-Club/library.git .
```

2. Secondly, you have to create _.env_ file in the root directory to fill variables from [.dist.env]

- DB_HOST must be equal to 'postgres'

```
touch .env
```

3. Finally, run the command

```
docker-compose up -d
```

👍 **Done!** 👍
